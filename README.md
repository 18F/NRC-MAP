# Mission Analytics Platform

## Objective
Improve reactor safety program data analytics and decision support to better serve internal and external stakeholders in a way that is harmonized across the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) mission area.


## Background
The reactor safety program has an intensely manual workload management and data retrieval process, resulting from too many disparate systems. This limits data analysis, performance management, and stakeholders’ access to consistent, timely information. This is rooted in uncoordinated business processes that can only produce static, custom reports on an ad hoc basis.

The current Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) and Office of New Reactors (NRO) will be re-merging in October 2019. This reorganization will enable the re-formed NRR to improve workload management, data analytics, and decision-making information service delivery for employees, customers, and stakeholders that relies on a consistent approach that unifies analytics framework, tools, and methodologies.

The agency has established a Master Data Management (MDM) program to ensure that the agency mission critical systems and staff have timely access to data collected, stored, and processed across the enterprise. The implementation of the MDM System (MDMS) helped reduce ambiguous sources and eliminate the storage of duplicate information. The system provides controls to improve the completeness and quality of the data, including the establishment of stewards for key data; and provides an enterprise- wide foundation for information sharing and exchange.
